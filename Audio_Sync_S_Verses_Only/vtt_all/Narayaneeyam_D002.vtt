O Lord of Guruvaayur! as creation progressed, the divine sages Sanaka and the others wanting to pay their respects to Thee went to Vaikuntha loka.

एवंभूतमनोज्ञतानवसुधानिष्यन्दसन्दोहनं
त्वद्रूपं परचिद्रसायनमयं चेतोहरं शृण्वताम् ।
सद्य: प्रेरयते मतिं मदयते रोमाञ्चयत्यङ्गकं
व्यासिञ्चत्यपि शीतवाष्पविसरैरानन्दमूर्छोद्भवै:

O Bestower of Boons! Then Thy devotee, the sage Naarada who is skillfully diplomatic in furthering Thy purposes, approached Hiranyaaksha, who was running about searching for Thee, in the cosmic waters which barely reached his knees. Naarada calmly spoke to him, praising him and undermining Thy prowess.

00:05:32 --> 00:06:32
एवंभूततया हि भक्त्यभिहितो योगस्स योगद्वयात्
कर्मज्ञानमयात् भृशोत्तमतरो योगीश्वरैर्गीयते ।
सौन्दर्यैकरसात्मके त्वयि खलु प्रेमप्रकर्षात्मिका

In this world when the intellect gets attached to the sense objects, which are the product of the three Gunas, it becomes the cause of bondage. Otherwise, it leads to liberation. The path of devotion indeed prevents attachment. Devotion which arises from following holy men alone should be sought after. Thou incarnate as Kapila thus instructed Devahooti.

00:05:32 --> 00:06:32
निष्कामं नियतस्वधर्मचरणं यत् कर्मयोगाभिधं
तद्दूरेत्यफलं यदौपनिषदज्ञानोपलभ्यं पुन: ।
तत्त्वव्यक्ततया सुदुर्गमतरं चित्तस्य तस्माद्विभो

00:05:32 --> 00:06:32
अत्यायासकराणि कर्मपटलान्याचर्य निर्यन्मला
बोधे भक्तिपथेऽथवाऽप्युचिततामायान्ति किं तावता ।
क्लिष्ट्वा तर्कपथे परं तव वपुर्ब्रह्माख्यमन्ये पुन-
