२

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
चतुर्दश-आत्मक-जगत्-रूपेण	in the form of the fourteen worlds

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
Thou then decided to carry out the festival of the love god, which Thou had promised to the Gopikaas when their vows had ended. One night, with the bright light of the full moon, when all the directions were cool, in the forest on the banks of the river Yamunaa, Thou resoundingly played the flute.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
तारमन्तरनुचिन्त्य सन्ततं प्राणवायुमभियम्य निर्मला: ।
इन्द्रियाणि विषयादथापहृत्यास्महे भवदुपासनोन्मुखा:

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
जात: पुन: -	manifesting (Thyself) again

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
Thou had decided to fulfil the desire of the beautiful women who had come to Thee. They were helpless as they were struck by Cupid's arrow for Thee. Yet Thou first spoke to them in an unfavourable manner.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
३

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
तस्य-ऊर्ध्वं खलु	at the head (peak) of that (the worlds)

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
The lotus eyed damsels were allowed to participate in the pleasant sport with Thee, the very pure embodied essence of the resplendent supreme bliss. They were immersed in boundless bliss and so they fell victim to great pride and self importance.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
अस्फुटे वपुषि ते प्रयत्नतो धारयेम धिषणां मुहुर्मुहु: ।
तेन भक्तिरसमन्तरार्द्रतामुद्वहेम भवदङ्घ्रिचिन्तका

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
सत्य-लोक-निलये	in the abode of Satyaloka

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
O Lotus eyed One! As the Gopikaas saw Thee and approached Thee, they were overcome with joy. They stood stupefied and motionless as if drenched in a downpour of Immortal Bliss, seeing Thee in front of them.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
४

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
जात: -असि धाता स्वयं	manifested as Brahma (the Creator) Thyself

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
A bunch of peacock feathers adorning the beautiful locks of hair; a pair of fish shaped earrings dangling from the ears; many necklaces intermingled with flower garlands adorning the neck; a golden girdle fastened to the yellow silk garment adorning the waist; sandal paste and other unguents smeared on the body emitting strong fragrance; gem studded anklets flashing forth a glow; on such a radiant form of Thee, with decorations appropriate for the Raasa, we meditate on.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
विस्फुटावयवभेदसुन्दरं त्वद्वपु: सुचिरशीलनावशात् ।
अश्रमं मनसि चिन्तयामहे ध्यानयोगनिरतास्त्वदाश्रयाः

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
यं शंसन्ति	whom (Brahma) (the Srutis) describe

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
In this manner, as Thou were entertaining the Gopikaas and they were immersed in bliss, the Gopas went to the temple of Lord Shiva, Ambikaa's (Paarvati's) husband. Thou went along with them to the temple which was in the forest named Ambikaa. After the divine festival had been performed, they all slept happily in the night. Then a fierce snake swallowed Nanda Gopa.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
५

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
हिरण्यगर्भम्-	(as) Hiranyagarbh

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
A close friend of the Bhoja king Kansa, Keshi was never unsuccessful in any of his attempts. He took the form of a horse from the land of Sindhu, thinking that Thou were easily accessible to those born off Sindhu (ocean) as Thou are to Laxmi Devi.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
ध्यायतां सकलमूर्तिमीदृशीमुन्मिषन्मधुरताहृतात्मनाम् ।
सान्द्रमोदरसरूपमान्तरं ब्रह्म रूपमयि तेऽवभासते

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
अखिल-त्रैलोक्य-जीवात्मकं	of all the beings in the three worlds as the collective soul

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
Then when Kansa came to know from Naarada that, Thou, O Lord! resting on the serpent king! Were residing in Vraja, his heart was full of fear. He called for Akrur, the son of Gaandini, and sent him for Thee under the pretext of inviting Thee to witness the bow worshipping festival.

00:04:26 --> 00:05:26
६

00:05:26 --> 00:06:26
य: -अभूत्	who became

00:06:26 --> 00:06:26
Then hearing the news of Thy impending departure the cowherd girls were very much saddened. They gathered together and lamented saying -'What is this? How and why is this happening?'
