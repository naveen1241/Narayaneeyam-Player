00:07:17 --> 00:07:17
O Lord! With Thy ear ornaments quivering rhythmically, Thou danced for long on the hoods of the serpent. As the gods in the sky beat the drums, the heavenly damsels sang in accompaniment.

00:05:17 --> 00:06:17
मरुद्गेहाधीश त्वयि खलु पराञ्चोऽपि सुखिनो

Day after day the Gopikas saw Thy form and were captivated. Thy form beautiful and fresh and soft like the Kalaaya flower, evoking the sentiment of love. Thy form charmingly enchanting everyone. Thy form, Brahman indeed, the personification of Existence, Reality, Supreme Consciousness and Bliss (Sat-Chit-Aananda).

00:05:17 --> 00:06:17
किमुक्तैर्भूयोभिस्तव हि करुणा यावदुदिया-

O Shauri! Once the cowherds were collecting the requisite material to perform a Yagya to appease Indra. Thou wanted to humble the pride of Indra. In spite of knowing what the preparations were for, Thou, in full humility and politeness asked Nanda and the other cowherds, 'O Father what is this your effort for?'

00:07:17 --> 00:07:17
At that moment, indeed, above the land of Vraja, were seen by Thee massive rain clouds continuously roaring and spreading. They caused all the quarters to tremble and they resembled Thy form in their brilliance.

The Gopaalakas witnessed Thy tremendous feats such as the lifting of the mountain and Thy great powers. They considered Thee to be the Lord of the Universe. All of them asked Nanda again and again about Thy horoscope.
