00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
Once when Thy mother was churning the curd, Thou approached her in the eagerness to be breast fed. Obstructing her churning Thou climbed up her lap and sucked at her breasts.

00:03:55 --> 00:04:55
मुनिप्रौढा रूढा जगति खलु गूढात्मगतयो
भवत्पादाम्भोजस्मरणविरुजो नारदमुखा: ।
चरन्तीश स्वैरं सततपरिनिर्भातपरचि -
त्सदानन्दाद्वैतप्रसरपरिमग्ना: किमपरम्

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
स्थिति:	was in existence

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
Thou were joyfully named Daamodara by the group of sages who were watching Thee with great happiness, and they praised and glorified Thee. Thou who with a tender belly were attached to the mortar, saw two Kakubha (Arjuna) trees not far away.

00:03:55 --> 00:04:55

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
तत्र-एक: - त्वम्-	then Thou as the Only One (without another)

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
The Gopas who were not aware of Thy glory and greatness, interpreted the falling of the trees and such other occurrences as unaccountable ill-omens. So they made up their minds and decided to migrate to some other place.

00:03:55 --> 00:04:55
भवद्भक्ति: स्फीता भवतु मम सैव प्रशमये-
दशेषक्लेशौघं न खलु हृदि सन्देहकणिका ।
न चेद्व्यासस्योक्तिस्तव च वचनं नैगमवचो
भवेन्मिथ्या रथ्यापुरुषवचनप्रायमखिलम्

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
अशिष्यथा: किल	did remain, certainly

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
In the beautiful Vrindaavana swarms of honey bees would fleet around. There, O Auspicious Lord! Consort of Laxmi! Accompanied by Haladhara and other cowherd boys, Thou moved about with Thy radiant form pleasing to the eyes. Keen on tending the cows, Thou carried a horn, flute and a cane.

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
परानन्द-प्रकाश-आत्मना	as Supreme Bliss Consciousness

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
Once Thou decided to have a picnic in the woods. Along with the children of Gokul and surrounded by a large herd of calves, Thou set out early in the morning. O Lord Thou also took along eatables, cooked rice and other delicacies.

00:03:55 --> 00:04:55
भवद्भक्तिस्तावत् प्रमुखमधुरा त्वत् गुणरसात्
किमप्यारूढा चेदखिलपरितापप्रशमनी ।
पुनश्चान्ते स्वान्ते विमलपरिबोधोदयमिल-
न्महानन्दाद्वैतं दिशति किमत: प्रार्थ्यमपरम्

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
एवं	in this manner

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
In all the other incarnations of Thee put together, not having seen such majesties as in the salvation of Aghaasura, Brahmaa decided to test Thy powers. He extended his power of Maayaa, illusion, and took the herds of calves into invisibleness, and hid them.

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
चतुर्दश-जगत्-मयतां गतस्य	(of Thee) who had manifested as the fourteen worlds

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
O Lord of the universe! Having passed childhood Thou attained the charming age of boyhood (6 to 10 years). Then Thou gave up the tending of the calves and enthusiastically promoted to herding cows and cattle.

00:03:55 --> 00:04:55
विधूय क्लेशान्मे कुरु चरणयुग्मं धृतरसं
भवत्क्षेत्रप्राप्तौ करमपि च ते पूजनविधौ ।
भवन्मूर्त्यालोके नयनमथ ते पादतुलसी-
परिघ्राणे घ्राणं श्रवणमपि ते चारुचरिते

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
पातालम्-	Paataal

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
Long ago, the sage named Saubhari who was eager to serve Thee, remained submerged in the waters of Kaalindi, for twelve years, performing austerities. He became attached to the fish who kept sporting there. Once he saw Garuda right in front of his eyes.

00:03:55 --> 00:04:55

00:04:55 --> 00:05:55
ईश	O Lord!

00:05:55 --> 00:05:55
O Lord! Thou then made up Thy mind to drive away the fierce serpent from the waters. Thou quickly approached and got up on a Kadamba tree standing on the bank of the river, with its leaves withered due to the poisonous breeze.
