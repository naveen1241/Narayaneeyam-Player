Then when intoxicated Balaraam was sporting happily and at will with the damsels, he called over Yamuna to him. When Yamuna did not comply to his wishes he subdued her by turning her course. At that time Paundraka Vaasudeva misled by the ill advice of his subordinates, sent a messenger to Thee.

00:03:45 --> 00:04:45
आस्थितोऽथ महरालये यदा शेषवक्त्रदहनोष्मणार्द्यते ।
ईयते भवदुपाश्रयस्तदा वेधस: पदमत: पुरैव वा

00:04:45 --> 00:05:45
स्थित: -	seated

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
Once then during the time of Solar eclipse, leaving behind Kritvarma and Anirudhdha in charge of Dwaarika, Thou went to the holy spot known as Samantapanchaka, along with the Yaadava clan and their womenfolk.

स कमलोद्भव: -	he, the lotus born (Brahmaa)

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
O Lord! The Magadha king Jaraasandh had 20800 kings as captives in his prison. The tormented kings sent a person as a messenger to Thee, the only refuge of the helpless. He prayed to Thee to kill the king of Magadha. What more can be said.

00:03:45 --> 00:04:45
तत्र वा तव पदेऽथवा वसन् प्राकृतप्रलय एति मुक्तताम् ।
स्वेच्छया खलु पुरा विमुच्यते संविभिद्य जगदण्डमोजसा

00:04:45 --> 00:05:45
तव हि नाभिपङ्केरुहे	in Thy navel lotus itself

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
Saalva of magical merits, who was defeated by the Yaadava army at the time of Rukmini's abduction, got Saubh the aerial car as a boon from Shivaa.When Thou were residing in the city of the Kurus, Indraprastha, Saalva attacked Thy city Dwaarika. Pradyumna resisted him heading the entire army of the Yaadavas, and killed his powerful minister Dyumanta. This battle lasted for 27 days.

कुत: स्वित्-	from where indeed

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
The Brahmin by the name Kuchela (Sudaamaa) was Thy fellow disciple in the hermitage of sage Saandipini. He was totally devoted to Thee. A house holder with a controlled mind and senses, he spent his days calmly without any worldly desires of wealth etc.

00:03:45 --> 00:04:45
तस्य च क्षितिपयोमहोऽनिलद्योमहत्प्रकृतिसप्तकावृती: ।
तत्तदात्मकतया विशन् सुखी याति ते पदमनावृतं विभो

इदम्-अम्बुधौ-उदितम्-	this (lotus) in the ocean has come up

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
Thy mother had long back heard of Thy having brought back Thy teacher Saandipini's son and she desired of Thee to be shown her six dead sons. By Thy mother's words Thou went to the Sutala land and met Mahaabali and were greatly honoured by him. From there Thou brought back the six sons who were originally Marichi's sons and were later born to Hiranyakashipu by a curse of Brahmaa. They later took birth as Vasudeva and Devaki's sons, who were killed by Kansa. Thou took them to Thy abode.

इति-अनालोकयन्	this not comprehending

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
O Consort of Ramaa! (Laxmi) Thy devotees are not easily blessed in this world. I know it to be so because prosperity generates pride in the passionate people. After making them dispassionate Thou do fulfill all their desires. Those who are already dispassionate, to them Thy blessings come quickly. There is no question of Thy devotee's downfall.

00:03:45 --> 00:04:45
अर्चिरादिगतिमीदृशीं व्रजन् विच्युतिं न भजते जगत्पते ।

तत्-ईक्षण-कुतूहलात्	out of eagerness to find the source

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
O Supreme Being! The episodes of Vrikaasura, Sage Bhrigu, Thy Mohini Avataar and the Ambareesh episode only proves, here, that Thy majesty and superiority supersedes over all other deities like Shiva and others.Thou are non-different from Thy Nishkala (partless) form and Thy Sakala (part) forms like Shiva, Brahamaa, and shine in an indescribable manner as the essence of all.

00:03:45 --> 00:04:45

00:04:45 --> 00:05:45
प्रतिदिशं विवृत्त-आनन: -	in all directions (he) turned his face

00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
O Lord Krishna! I believe that the worship of Thy feet is the most fear expelling and the only refuge for those mortals who are suffering because of being deeply bound by the false material notions and wrong acceptance of ephemeral values as true. By devotion to Thee all fear is expelled, in every way, the methods of which are taught by Thee (in Bhagvad Geeta etc.). O Lord of Lords! O Soul of all Beings! A person who is steady in Thy devotion will not slip or falter even a wee bit even if he runs on the path of delusion with his eyes closed.
