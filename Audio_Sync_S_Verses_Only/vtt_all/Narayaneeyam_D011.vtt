WEBVTT

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
व्यक्ताव्यक्तमिदं न किञ्चिदभवत्प्राक्प्राकृतप्रक्षये
मायायाम् गुणसाम्यरुद्धविकृतौ त्वय्यागतायां लयम् ।
नो मृत्युश्च तदाऽमृतं च समभून्नाह्नो न रात्रे: स्थिति-
स्तत्रैकस्त्वमशिष्यथा: किल परानन्दप्रकाशात्मना

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
चतु:-वदनताम्-अगात्-	(and thus) became endowed with four faces

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
Understanding that the rituals described in the Vedas are beyond their seeming results-oriented nature, I shall dedicate all such rituals that I perform, to Thee O Lord! And become free from the bondage of action. May I not, even by mistake, by thought deed or speech attempt to do what is forbidden by the Vedas. If any such action becomes unavoidable, that too I will dedicate to Thee alone, O The Glowing Light of Consciousness!

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
१

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
विकसत्-अष्ट-दृष्टि-अम्बुजाम्	with eight eyes (beautiful) like full blown lotuses

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
Thy grace alone will enable me to abandon my love and affection towards my relatives. With my mind merged in Thee, renouncing everything, I will wander about looking upon the whole world as an expression of Maayaa. The injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures apply to the one who entertains the concepts of good or bad due to multiplicity caused by false comprehension. How can both of these apply to a person whose mind is absorbed in Thee and who has transcended the consciousness of differences.

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
काल: कर्म गुणाश्च जीवनिवहा विश्वं च कार्यं विभो
चिल्लीलारतिमेयुषि त्वयि तदा निर्लीनतामाययु: ।
तेषां नैव वदन्त्यसत्त्वमयि भो: शक्त्यात्मना तिष्ठतां
नो चेत् किं गगनप्रसूनसदृशां भूयो भवेत्संभव:

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
वैकुण्ठ	O Lord of Vaikuntha loka !

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
People, whose minds are purified by performing desireless actions, come to understand from the instructions of competent teachers, Thy supreme aspect which is immaculate, bodiless, taintless, all pervading and transcendent. As for the qualities of multiplicity, stoutness, thinness etc., which are in association with the bodies constituted of the three gunas, are super imposed on Thee. It is like the expensiveness, small ness, dimness and brilliance of fire according to the nature of the fuel (wood) on which it manifests.

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
२

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
वर्धित-बल: -अथ	(Brahmaa) whose strength had enhanced then

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
O Thou! The Origin of All! In the beginning Thou were in an undivided state of all jivas in the Hiranyagarbha form. Then Thou do manifest Thyself in multiplicity of jivas, and become associated with Maayaa and its various Gunas. With the well developed and dominant Sattva, devotional attitude is reached, by which the other two gunas Rajas and Tamas are destroyed. By and by when Sattva also is abandoned I (the jiva) shall, again, unobstructed, realise myself as Thyself only.

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
एवं च द्विपरार्धकालविगतावीक्षां सिसृक्षात्मिकां
बिभ्राणे त्वयि चुक्षुभे त्रिभुवनीभावाय माया स्वयम् ।
मायात: खलु कालशक्तिरखिलादृष्टं स्वभावोऽपि च
प्रादुर्भूय गुणान्विकास्य विदधुस्तस्यास्सहायक्रियाम्

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
भवत्-प्रसादात्-	by Thy grace

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
O Thou of infinite Glory! Of whom the world is a personification! Thou alone are Brahmaa perceptible. Among letters Thou are 'A'. Among Mantraas Thou are Om. Among kings Thou are Manu and among sages are Bhrigu and also Naarada. Among Asuras Thou are Prahlaad. Thou are the Surabhi celestial cow among the animals and Garuda among the birds. Among serpents Thou are Ananta. Among the rivers Thou are the heavenly Gangaa.

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
३

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
अम्भोज्योनि: -	the lotus born (Brahmaa)

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
All entities in this world, knowledge, faith, work, residence, happiness, food etc., being constituted of the three gunas, are of different kinds and different gradations, such as, low, mediocre or high. But entities and activities pertaining to Thee, Thy temples and Thy worship are beyond these three gunas. By resorting to these, I will soon become perfect (free).

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
मायासन्निहितोऽप्रविष्टवपुषा साक्षीति गीतो भवान्
भेदैस्तां प्रतिबिंबतो विविशिवान् जीवोऽपि नैवापर: ।
कालादिप्रतिबोधिताऽथ भवता संचोदिता च स्वयं
माया सा खलु बुद्धितत्त्वमसृजद्योऽसौ महानुच्यते

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
असृजत् किल	created it is said

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
It is Brahaman itself, on whose base this universe is manifested, from which this universe became, into which it merges, which itself is the universe, who is transcended from this all, from whose illumination the universe is illumined, whose illumination it is. Again, who is far beyond all description and also from the mind's conception. Whose true nature the gods and sages do not know, what of other lesser beings. To That Krishna, Brahaman itself, salutations.

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
४

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
जीवदेहान्	bodies for jeevas

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
Who can recount the glories of the All Pervading Lord Vishnu or count the sand particles of the universe? The three strides of His feet alone measured the three worlds, and the worlds are full of joy with wealth and prosperity because of the touch of His feet. He alone is the support of the worlds. His supreme abode is dear to me and may I attain it, where Thy devotees enjoy bliss and the honey juice of immortality flows free.

00:02:59 --> 00:03:59
तत्रासौ त्रिगुणात्मकोऽपि च महान् सत्त्वप्रधान: स्वयं
जीवेऽस्मिन् खलु निर्विकल्पमहमित्युद्बोधनिष्पाद्क: ।
चक्रेऽस्मिन् सविकल्पबोधकमहन्तत्त्वं महान् खल्वसौ
सम्पुष्टं त्रिगुणैस्तमोऽतिबहुलं विष्णो भवत्प्रेरणात्

00:03:59 --> 00:04:59
स्थानूनि	the non-moving entities (trees etc.)

00:04:59 --> 00:04:59
In front of me I see a bluish radiance excelling a very thick array of Kalaaya (blue lily) flowers. I am bathed in the nectar of the sight. Then, in the centre of the radiance I see the form of a divine young body enchanting by the budding of youth. He is surrounded by sages like Naarada thrilled with ecstatic bliss, and by a group of beautiful women who are the Upanishads embodied.
