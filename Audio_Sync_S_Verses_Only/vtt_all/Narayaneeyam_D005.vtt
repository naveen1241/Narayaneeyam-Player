When the leader of the Yadu clan Vasudeva set out carrying Thee, he saw the waters of the Yamuna river flooded to the skies. Lo! As he crossed, the waters were reduced to the ankles of his feet as if the huge expanse of water was an illusory flood caused by magic.

Once, O Lord of Guruvaayur! Thou who had very much increased in weight, Thy mother not being able to carry Thee, placed Thee on the bed. What indeed was the cause of this, thus overcome with misgivings, she kept busy carrying out her duties in the house. As she did so, she was constantly thinking of Thee and praying for Thy welfare.

O Lord Muraari! Thou and Thy brother Balaraam soon moved about on Thy hands and knees. When Thou moved about, Thou looked so beautiful that it was like your movements adorned the various parts of the house. With Thy movements, Thy ankle trinkets tinkled pleasingly, and so to increase the pleasing sound Thou charmingly moved about with more briskness.
