00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
सूर्य-स्पर्धि-किरीटम्-	with a crown which rivals the Sun (in brilliance)

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
O Lord! I meditate upon Thy form: wearing a crown that rivals the sun in brilliance, the forehead adorned with the upright sandal paste mark (tilak), the all merciful eyes, the sweet smile, shapely nose, with cheeks reflecting the fish shaped pendants adorning Thy ears, the neck shining due to the lustre of Kaustubha gem, Thy chest bedecked with the Vanamaala, necklaces of gold and precious stones and the auspicious mark of Sreevatsa.

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
ऊर्ध्वतिलक-प्रोद्भासि-फालान्तरम्	by the upright mark (tilak of sandal paste) whose forehead is made more resplendent,

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
The Supreme Reality-The Brahma Tatwa ,which is dense concentrated Bliss, which is of the nature of the Pure Consciousness, which is without parallel or comparison, and is totally free of time and space limitations, and is always free (of Maya) which hundreds and thousands of the Upanishadic statements seek to explain, and yet, is not clear. This Brahma Tatwa which is not easy to grasp in the beginning, but the realisation of which, is the highest purusharth (i.e. liberation), that (very Reality) shines right in front (in concrete form), (as an Image of Shri Krishna) in the Guruvaayur temple. Oh (wonderful indeed) is the good fortune of the people (who seek Thy Grace).

00:05:58 --> 00:06:58
केयूराङ्गदकङ्कणोत्तममहारत्नाङ्गुलीयाङ्कित-
श्रीमद्बाहुचतुष्कसङ्गतगदाशङ्खारिपङ्केरुहाम् ।
काञ्चित् काञ्चनकाञ्चिलाञ्च्छितलसत्पीताम्बरालम्बिनी-
मालम्बे विमलाम्बुजद्युतिपदां मूर्तिं तवार्तिच्छिदम्

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
कारुण्य-आकुलनेत्रम्-	whose eyes are brimming with mercy

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
O Lord! Bestow on me just that much of health necessary to worship Thee. Then I shall practice the eight-limbed yoga (Ashtanga Yoga) and earn Thy grace.

00:05:58 --> 00:06:58
२

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
आर्द्र-हसित-उल्लासम्	(whose face) is lit up with a benevolent smile

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
This world consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest worlds (gross and the subtle) did not exist at all, before and during the total dissolution.The three Gunaas (Satwa, Rajas and Tamas) of Maya were in equilibrium, preventing any modification and so had become latent in Thee. At that time neither death nor liberation existed. Day and night also did not exist. Thou alone remained at that time as the Supreme Bliss Consciousness.

00:05:58 --> 00:06:58
यत्त्त्रैलोक्यमहीयसोऽपि महितं सम्मोहनं मोहनात्
कान्तं कान्तिनिधानतोऽपि मधुरं माधुर्यधुर्यादपि ।
सौन्दर्योत्तरतोऽपि सुन्दरतरं त्वद्रूपमाश्चर्यतोऽ-
प्याश्चर्यं भुवने न कस्य कुतुकं पुष्णाति विष्णो विभो

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
सुनासापुटम्	with a shapely nose

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
O Lord! Thou took the wonderful form of the fourteen worlds as Thy Viraat Swaroopa : The lower worlds - Paataala -is the lower portion of Thy feet. Rasaatala - is the upper portion of Thy feet. Mahaatala is Thy two ankles.

00:05:58 --> 00:06:58

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
गण्डोद्यन्-मकर-आभ-कुण्डल-युगम्	with cheeks shining due to the brilliance of a pair of fish shaped ear pendants

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
Thus O Lord! Thou who manifested in the form of the fourteen worlds, again by Thy own will, manifested as Brahma, in Satyaloka, which is the highest and loftiest of all the worlds.This Brahma is known as Hiranya Garbh (the golden egg) the cosmic intelligence of all the beings of the three worlds. With the upsurge of Rajoguna, Thou as this Hiranya Garbha became desirous of creating various beings.

00:05:58 --> 00:06:58
तत्तादृङ्मधुरात्मकं तव वपु: सम्प्राप्य सम्पन्मयी
सा देवी परमोत्सुका चिरतरं नास्ते स्वभक्तेष्वपि ।
तेनास्या बत कष्टमच्युत विभो त्वद्रूपमानोज्ञक -

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
कण्ठोज्ज्वलत्-कौस्तुभम्	with the Kaustubh jewel shining on the neck

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
At the end of the Prakrit Pralaya, in the first Kalpa which is known as Braahma Kalpa, Brahmaa came into existence. He got the knowledge of the Vedas from Thee alone and began creation in the same way as in the previous Kalpas.

00:05:58 --> 00:06:58

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
त्वत्-रूपम्	Thy form

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
Brahma sitting on the full blown lotus emerging from Thy lotus-like navel, and wondering about its origin looked all around by turning his face in all the directions. He was thus endowed with four faces and lotus-like eight beautiful eyes.

00:05:58 --> 00:06:58
लक्ष्मीस्तावकरामणीयकहृतैवेयं परेष्वस्थिरे-
त्यस्मिन्नन्यदपि प्रमाणमधुना वक्ष्यामि लक्ष्मीपते ।
ये त्वद्ध्यानगुणानुकीर्तनरसासक्ता हि भक्ता जना-
स्तेष्वेषा वसति स्थिरैव दयितप्रस्तावदत्तादरा

00:06:58 --> 00:07:58
वनमाल्य-हार-पटल-श्रीवत्सदीप्रम्	(and Thy bosom) resplendent with garlands of flowers (and tulsi) necklaces ( of pearls and gems) and the mark of Srivatsa

00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
O Lord of Vaikuntha! by Thy grace, with increased spiritual powers, Brahmaa started creation. He created varieties of beings, those that grow on earth and are non-moving like trees etc., as well as the moving, like animals birds etc., human beings and various divine beings. These serve as bodies for the jeevas to enter into.
