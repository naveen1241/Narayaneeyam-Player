Thou emerged from the ocean as Dhanvantari holding the pot of nectar which the Asuras snatched from Thy hands. The devas became helpless. After consoling them, Thou immediately disappeared. O Lord! Then prompted by Thy Maayaa the Asuras started to quarrel amongst themselves.

The high souled Bali was killed in the battle by Indra, but his body was revived by Shukraachaarya. By performing the Vishwajit Sacrifice he grew in prowess and being a descendent of Prahlaad, he was not afraid of Thy discus. So Devas had to flee in fear of the victorious Bali who conquered the three worlds where the Devas had hid themselves.

Long ago during the Pralaya which took place at the end of the sixth Manvantara, when Brahmaa was about to sleep, the great Asura Hayagreeva stole the Vedas from his mouth. In order to restore them, Thou decided to incarnate as a fish.

The Devas prayed to Thee for the destruction of Raavana. In the kingdom of Kosala, the sage Rishyashringa performed the Putrakaameshti Ynjya on the request of the King Dashratha. From the Yanajya emerged the divine paayasa which the king distributed among his three wives, by eating it they conceived simultaneously. Thou were born to them as Raama, then yourself as Lakshmana ,also as Bharat, and Shatrughna, by these names.

Having taken alliance with Sugreeva which was brought about by Hanumaan, Thou flung far away the corpse of the Asura Dundubhi with Thy toe and also cut through seven Saala trees by a single arrow simultaneously, to demonstrate Thy strength to Sugreeva. Baali who was incomparable in strength and was eager to kill Sugreeva was killed by Thee by using a strategy. Thou then spent the rainy season tormented by the pangs of separation from Seetaa, near the hermitage of sage Matanga.

Long ago Thou were born as Dattatreya to the sage Atri and Anasooyaa. Mentally tired by the pesterings of Thy various disciples, Thou wandered about with Thy wife immersed in blissful peace. Thus Thou were seen by the great devotee Kaartaviryaarjuna, the king of Hehaya. Pleased, Thou bestowed on him all psychic powers consisting of the eight Sidhis and also promised him death at Thy hands in the end.

O Lord Hari! Condensed bliss incarnate! Long ago, in the battle between the Devas and Asuras, some of the Asuras, even though slain by Thee,did not get liberation because of their residual Karmas. So they were born again on the earth. Mother earth being very much tormented by their burden sought refuge in Brahmaa and reached his abode, where the Devas had already gone.
