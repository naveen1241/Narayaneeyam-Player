      The Supreme Reality-The Brahma Tatwa ,which is dense concentrated Bliss, which is of the nature of the Pure Consciousness, which is without parallel or comparison, and is totally free of time and space limitations, and is always free (of Maya) which hundreds and thousands of the Upanishadic statements seek to explain, and yet, is not clear. This Brahma Tatwa which is not easy to grasp in the beginning, but the realisation of which, is the highest purusharth (i.e. liberation), that (very Reality) shines right in front (in concrete form), (as an Image of Shri Krishna) in the Guruvaayur temple. Oh (wonderful indeed) is the good fortune of the people (who seek Thy Grace).

      That Satva Guna, which compared to the other two Gunas (Rajas and Tamas) is absolutely pure and not tainted by them. From such pure Satva guna,Thy form was born, constituted of subtle elements and organs of senses and actions. It is thus stated by sage Vyaasa, again and again, in many scriptures.Thy form, because of such purity, totally reveals the Supreme Bliss and Consciousness within (which is the resplendent Brahman) without any obstruction. In that form, the fortunate ones (who have good deeds to their credit) revel. That form is delightful to the mind and ears, which the devotees can easily grasp in Thy image.

Just like the waves rise in the ocean, it is said that Thy Shuddha Satwa form has risen from the Brahman. Since the term Ansha-avataar (Sakalaa) is meant only for Thy other part incarnations. Hence why cannot Thou be called as Poorna-avataar (Nishkalaa)?

      O Invincible Lord! Thy activity of creation is indeed a tragic sport, as it causes a lot of sufferings to the living beings. This is what I used to think, but now I do not think so. For if there were no creation, how could human beings enjoy the beauty and sweetness of Thy form which is so delightful to hear and ecstatic to behold, and thus revel in the ocean of Supreme-Bliss-Consciousness.

Hence all fortunate jeevas [souls] take immense delight in the inexhaustible bliss that Thou are. As for Thee, Thou are ever satisfied in Thyself and are the abode of incomparable attributes. O Lord! prostrations to Thee.

      O changeless One! what a pity. Thy consort Laxmi Devi, the Goddess of prosperity and auspiciousness,having attained Thee in marriage, became so attached to Thy enchanting form, and was so much in love with Thee, that she was not inclined to be with even her own devotees. Alas, O Lord! due to her attachment to Thee, she acquired the reputation of being fickle minded towards her own devotees.

Bhakti yoga which is of the nature of pure love to Thee is the sweetest and the noblest and hence most beneficial.

They, without melting their hearts in love for Thee, take a long time to reach their goal of perfection.

The one who desires to visit the heavenly regions before attaining liberation, goes out through the orifice in the crown of the head ( the Brahmarandhra).

At that time neither death nor liberation existed. Day and night also did not exist. Thou alone remained at that time as the Supreme Bliss Consciousness.

These supported Maayaa by disturbing the balance of the three Gunaas and diversified as the manifested universe.

Thy appearances in the diverse forms of Maayaa are mere reflections called Jivas which are not different from Thee. Maayaa being aroused by time and prompted by Thee, projected the principle of Intelligence, which is called Mahat.

(As cosmic whole and not as individual entities). But the same Mahat Tatwa, when predominated by Tamas and Rajas, creates by Thy will the feeling of individual "I" called Aham Tatwa.

From the Tanmaatra of Taste (Rasa) came the element Water (Jala) and from it smell (Gandha). From smell (Gandha) came the element Earth (Bhoomi). O Maadhava! By Thy will, thus from the Tamasa aspect of Ahankaara, were born the five Tanmaatras and the five Pancha Bhootas each element having the qualities of the preceding one.

A charming benevolent smile is sported on Thy pleasant face. Thy four arms  are adorned with the sacred conch, discus, mace and lotus. That form of Thine gave immense pleasure to Brahmaa. May that form deign to eradicate my ailments.

      O Lord of the Universe! Brahmaa was wonderstruck by Thy vision. He was overwhelmed with the ecstasy of joy and with love and a sense of fulfilment . He fell at Thy lotus feet and prostrated. He prayed to Thee that Thou surely knew his desire to create, and so he asked for the required knowledge. He also prayed to be given the knowledge of the unique dual and the non-dual aspect of Thee. I pray to That Thee.

Thou touched his hand with Thy hands and said to him that he would get the knowledge required for creation, and also that he will not be  tainted by the act of creation.Giving him this assurance and pleasing him extremely, Thou ,remaining in his heart, prompted him in the act of creation. O Lord! of such benevolence, kindly hasten my recovery.

      A great anger arose in Brahma, because he was refused his bidding by his mental sons, which he tried to suppress. This caused the birth of Mrida from between his eyebrows, who is a part incarnation of Thine. Mrida at once cried out and told Brahmaa to provide him with names and abodes. Thus Mrida came to be known as Rudra.

      O Lord! Then seeing the earth concealed at the bottom of the Rasaatal, by the wretched Asura, Thou hastily lifted it up with the tip of the tusk of the boar, a form which Thou had asummed by Maaya. Treating the Asura with disdain who was rushing at Thee. All this was a mere sport for Thee.

      Owing to the extreme indulgence given to him by Brahmaa, Daksha was blinded with haughtiness and overpowered by Rajoguna. Alas! He had no respect for Thee and had lost his mental calmness.

      After his destruction, the sages feared that the absence of a ruler would lead to the tyranny of wicked people. So they took the body of Vena from his mother who had preserved it for a long time and churned the thighs. Thus his body became sinless. Then when his arms were churned, from there Thou appeared (in the form of Prithu).

      O Lord of the three worlds! As Thou (as Prithu) were performing sacrifices to Thyself, and were to begin the hundredth Ashwamedha Yanjya, Indra became jealous. In the guise of a lowly person he stole the Yanjya horse. He was then defeated by Thy son (Vijitashwana).

      Unperturbed, Chitraketu did not ask for relief from the curse, and was born as Vritraasura. By his devotion, while fighting in the battle against Indra, he imparted the knowledge of the self to Indra and he removed the delusion of even his enemy. Thereby he reached Thy abode. What a wonder!

      The evil minded Hiranyakashipu had Prahlaad brain washed by competent instructors for long, because he saw signs of devotion to Thee and also the ridicule of the Asuras in his son. He however rejected all their teachings as leading only to evil and grew up with his devotional zeal.

      On being asked about what was the best that he had learned, he answered that devotion to Thee was the greatest. Agitated at this, Hiranyakashipu was very angry with the teachers, but they told him that this was his son's natural inclination. At this he started planning ways to kill Prahlaad who was Thy great devotee, having taken refuge at Thy feet.

Thou then with great glee drank again and again the blood that gushed out of the Asura's body,fiercely roaring with lion roars which were powerful enough to shatter the whole universe.

      When the Asuras were wrongfully contemplating that Thou as Mohini were fond of them, and so were waiting silently, Thou finished the nectar among the Devas, as Thou always favour Thy devotees.

By performing the Vishwajit Sacrifice he grew in prowess and being a descendent of Prahlaad, he was not afraid of Thy discus. So Devas had to flee in fear of the victorious Bali who conquered the three worlds where the Devas had hid themselves.

      To me, who is the lord of all the three worlds how do you ask for mere three paces of earth? You simpleton! Of what use is this? Ask for the whole earth.' Thus he proudly told Thee. Because of this pride he failed to give fully even three paces of earth and invited ridicule and bondage. Bali did not deserve it but he was subjected to all this for acquiring complete detachment.

To test Bali's integrity, and so by Thy prompting the Guru of Asuras, Shukraachaarya, told him clearly to refrain from giving the gift since Thou were Hari.

      The Devas prayed to Thee for the destruction of Raavana. In the kingdom of Kosala, the sage Rishyashringa performed the Putrakaameshti Ynjya on the request of the King Dashratha. From the Yanajya emerged the divine paayasa which the king distributed among his three wives, by eating it they conceived simultaneously. Thou were born to them as Raama, then yourself as Lakshmana ,also as Bharat, and Shatrughna, by these names.

      To keep Thy father's words Thou proceeded to go to the forest accompanied by Thy consort Seetaa, and brother Lakshmana, armed with a bow. The crowd of citizens stricken with grief, who followed Thee, Thou sent back and on the way went to the residence of Guha. In an ascetic garb of bark cloth and matted hair Thou crossed the Gangaa in a boat and paid obeisance to sage Bharadwaaja who lived near by. On the sage's instruction Thou camped on the great mountain Chitrakoota and lived there very happily.

      While searching for Seetaa, the dying Jataayu informed Thee that Raavana had abducted Seetaa and also had inflicted fatal wounds on him, when offered resistance.Thou performed the funeral rites of this friend Jataayu. On the way the monster Kabandha obstructed Thee and was killed. Thou then gave salvation to the ascetic woman Shabari and also got to meet Hanumaana on the banks of the river Pampaa, to Thy great delight. O Lord of Guruvaayur! protect me.

The monkeys very diligently started on the mission to search for Thy consort Seeta.

      The monkeys from all the quarters brought mountains and rocks by which Thou got a bridge built across Lanka.Crossing over Thy army of monkeys attacked the Raakshasas with teeth claws mountains rocks and palm trees as weapons. With Thy brother displaying terrific power in the battle field, Raavana's son Indrajit soon tied down Thy troops with Naagaastra. Garuda, Thy vehicle soon released them from that state by fanning them with his wings.

Pangs of separation are caused by extreme attachment, as also extreme addiction to Dharma may lead to the abandoning of the innocent. Otherwise for Thee who are established in self consciousness how can such a weakness of mind be explained. O Wielder of the Discuss! Thou That very embodiment of the Satva guna! O The Lord of Guruvayur! eradicate my sufferings from the disease.

      Long ago Thou were born as Dattatreya to the sage Atri and Anasooyaa. Mentally tired by the pesterings of Thy various disciples, Thou wandered about with Thy wife immersed in blissful peace. Thus Thou were seen by the great devotee Kaartaviryaarjuna, the king of Hehaya. Pleased, Thou bestowed on him all psychic powers consisting of the eight Sidhis and also promised him death at Thy hands in the end.

Thou were the youngest among Jamadagni's sons and gave Thy parents great joy.

Several warriors emerged from the furious divine cow and destroyed the whole army. But the calf was stolen.

      Thy father was brought back to life by Shukraachaarya. When Thy father related the whole incident Thou were very angry. With Thy friend Akritavrana Thou meditated upon Mahodara who then equipped Thee with bow, arrows and the battle axe. Boarding the chariot with the horses and the charioteer, Thou entered Maahishmati. Even when the king was requested, he did not give the calf back, Thou started the battle.

That Kaartaveerya, wielded various weapons with those thousand arms and finding the Vaishnava discus also powerless against Thee, knew Thee to be Hari, and with joy meditated upon Thee. Then, he whose sins were purified, was killed by Thee and he went to Thy Supreme abode.

      Abandoning all weapons, Thou resorted to the Mahendra mountain for meditation, practicing penance. Finding the land up to Gokarna submerged in the sea, on the request of the sages, who meditated upon Thee, Thou frightened the ocean with the bow bearing fire missile. By throwing a sacrificial ladle Thou pushed back the sea and scooped out the land of Kerala. O Bhrigupati Parashuraama! The Lord of Guruvaayur! Deign to protect me.

      O Lord Hari! Condensed bliss incarnate! Long ago, in the battle between the Devas and Asuras, some of the Asuras, even though slain by Thee,did not get liberation because of their residual Karmas. So they were born again on the earth. Mother earth being very much tormented by their burden sought refuge in Brahmaa and reached his abode, where the Devas had already gone.

      The evil minded Kansa who  had caught hold of Devaki by her hair did not release her in spite of the repeated conciliatory words of Shauri (Vasudeva). Then at the offer of Vasudeva to surrender his children, he was satisfied and went home. The first born Thy brother, though handed over to Kansa as promised, he did not kill the child out of love. For, O Lord! even wicked people are found to be very compassionate in the heart, once in a while.

      Then awakened by the sound of crying of Thy younger sister, the host of attendants ran fast to inform Kansa of the child's birth. Stricken with fear, Kansa, with dishevelled hair, hastily reached the spot and was surprised and confused to see a baby girl in his sister's arms.

By worshipping Shiva they also attained great prosperity and because of the pride of wealth they became very haughty and indifferent to Thee. For a very long time they led a very wayward life.

      O Lord of the Universe! The great gods praised Thee saying that the meal taken happily with the Gopa boys gave Thee more pleasure than the sacrificial offerings which Thou had received with the gods. O Thou Residing in Guruvaayur! Save me from my ailments.

      Long ago, the sage named Saubhari who was eager to serve Thee, remained submerged in the waters of Kaalindi, for twelve years, performing austerities. He became attached to the fish who kept sporting there. Once he saw Garuda right in front of his eyes.

Thou spent such a season enjoying in the forests and happily grazing grass to the cattle in the pleasant forests. O Thou! bestow unto me good health.

      Day after day and again and again, in this manner, the Cupid caused promptings to the Gopikaas. This was, in a way, a blessing to them. As it made them so bonded in attachment towards Thee, that they became helpless and so always attained indifference in the worldly concerns.

Indeed, Thy words are to be followed for they are in accordance with the Dharma. But the actions of Thee who are ever pure, should not be practiced by others, because Thy actions do not always conform to the good and bad standards of the world.

      A bunch of peacock feathers adorning the beautiful locks of hair; a pair of fish shaped earrings dangling from the ears; many necklaces intermingled with flower garlands adorning the neck; a golden girdle fastened to the yellow silk garment adorning the waist; sandal paste and other unguents smeared on the body emitting strong fragrance; gem studded anklets flashing forth a glow; on such a radiant form of Thee, with decorations appropriate for the Raasa, we meditate on.

The clapping of the hands mingled with the tingling sound of the bangles. During the dance, time and again Thou placed Thy lotus hands on the shoulders of the Gopikaas. As they danced about, the clothings on their waists fluttered. On such enthralling majesty of the Raas Dance let us meditate.

      O Lord! The singing stopped gradually and the musical instruments also ceased. But immersed deeply in the joy of Brahmic Bliss the women kept dancing in a circle. They were not even aware of the knot of clothing strings loosening or of their bodice having slipped or of their hair being dishevelled. The stars in the sky stood still in their courses, to enjoy all this. What more can I say?

      O Lotus Eyed One! He gradually entered Vrindaavana which is sanctified by Thy feet and revered by Shiva, Brahma and other gods. As Akrura approached Vrindaavana he was as if immersed in bliss or was under a spell. What states of ecstasy did he not attain!

      Thou said 'O wicked one move away from the way quickly'. At this the cruel and angry minded mahout prompted the elephant, who taking great speed caught Thee in its tusks.

Thou then hid between the elephant's legs for sometime and then came out smiling sweetly.

      To the sages who meditate, just as Thou seem to be in their grasp but suddenly elude them, so also Thou escaped even when Thou were in the grasp of the elephant, running away just when it seemed to catch hold of Thee. Thou then playfully threw him on the ground. As he again rushed towards Thee, Thou pulled out its tooth from the root of its tusk. From there emerged priceless large pearls which Thou gave to Thy friend asking him to get them made into a beautiful necklace and give it to Raadhaa.

      Alas! How bad! The two boys are tender bodied and the two wrestlers are tough. We will go away quickly and not see this unequal contest,' thus the people were talking among themselves.

      Kansa asked for the drums to be stopped. Then the wicked one not knowing what to do ordered for Thy respected parents to be killed. O Omnipresent Lord! He also ordered that Thou be driven away to a remote place. Thou were very annoyed at his wicked words. Thou leaped with determination to the throne of Kansa to the highest balcony of his palace, like a Garuda ascends to the top of the mountain, and gripped him, the son of Ugrasena, though he was difficult to catch hold of because he resisted with brandishing a sword.

      Gokula's prosperity was an indication of the magnitude of Thy greatness. Reaching there in the evening, Uddhava delighted Nanda and Yashodaa with Thy many news. In the morning the lotus eyed women of Gokula saw the bejewelled chariot and suspected Thy arrival. They came to know that one of Thy emissaries had come. Abandoning their work, they gathered at the house of Nandagopa.

      The Gopikas saw Uddhava donning charming clothes and ornaments similar to Thine. They remembered Thee again and again and Thy various deeds and sports very thoroughly. They were full of emotions and were choking for words, and somehow managed to speak to Uddhava with faltering words. They had forgotten to observe the norms of behaviour and courtesies, and the differences between themselves and others.

      The Gopikas bemoaned  their fate with such words of despair and were overwhelmed with grief. Uddhava comforted them with Thy message of deep spiritual import. They came to their normal selves and thereafter experienced Thy inner presence. Uddhava spent some days with the totally devoted Gopikas joyfully and happily narrating various incidents about Thee.

      The Gopikas always sang songs about Thee. Everywhere while doing their household chores, they narrated Thine tales, amongst themselves. They even spoke about Thee in their dreams.Their actions were mostly imitations of Thy actions as they tried to personify Thee. Everything that there, was permeated by Thy presence. Observing all this that great devotee Uddhava was wonderstruck and left stunned.

      Such devotion is neither seen nor heard of in the whole world. Of what use is the study of so many scriptures and the practices there in. And what is the use here of all penances. May there be salutations to the Gopikaas.' Thus Uddhava joyfully exclaimed when he returned from Gokula and met Thee. O Lord of Guruvaayur! Who were happy to see Uddhava, save me from so many of my afflictions.

      Thou then like a greedy man asked for the divine Syamantaka jewel from Satraajit who had got it from the Sun god. O Lord! The reasons for this may be many. What appeals to me indeed is that this was a strategy by which Thou wanted to marry his daughter (Satyabhaamaa) who was in love with Thee.

      The narrow minded one (Satraajit) did not give the precious jewel to Thee. His brother Prasena wore it round his neck and went away hunting. A lion mistook the jewel because of its brilliance to be a lump of flesh and so he killed Prasena. The great monkey (Jaambavaana) killed the lion and gave the jewel to his child.

      Influenced by the allegations of Satraajit, people suspected that Thou had stolen the jewel. Even a slight fault in the conduct of the virtuous person is like nectar for people in general, for it gives them a chance to slight that person. In spite of the fact that Thou knew everything about the jewel, Thou went in search for it with Thy men. Thou saw Prasena and the lion lying dead and thus were led to the monkey (Jaambavaan's) cave.

      When Thou were delighting the shy Satyabhaamaa, there was the news of Kunti's sons being burnt in the wax palace. So Thou went away to the land of the Kurus. Under the promptings of Akrura and Kritvermaa, Shatadhanu killed Satraajit and took away the jewel.

      Thy younger sister, the virtuous Subhadraa was sought in marriage by the Kuru prince Duryodhana. She was carried away by Indra's son Arjuna in the guise of an ascetic at Thy behest. Balaraama was enraged at this but was later pacified by Thee. Thou then went with him and Satyabhaamaa to Indraprastha to the great delight of Thy dear friend Arjuna.

Then Narakaasura with his regiment of mighty four tusked elephants gave a prolonged tough fight. Thou cut off his head also and made him pass over hell (and saved him from the suffering of hell).

      Baana came attacking ferociously with 500 bows and arrows, but his weapons being severed he had to retreat. Thereupon, the head of all the obsession, the Shaiva obsession came to the forefront but was immediately put out by the Vaishnava obsession. The enlightened Shaivas gave freedom to all those that sung Thy excellences and went away praising Thee. Often the enlightened Rudras also act ferociously, being predominated by Tamas.

      Baana again attacked ferociously full of arrogance with his many various weapons. Thou made him devoid of all vice and his many arms by cutting them off. Shankara soon realised Thy greatness and praised Thee and on his request Thou let off Baana with his two arms on both sides. Baana who was then spared from the fear of death honoured Thee. Thou then returned to Thy city Dwaarikaa with Aniruddha and Ushaa.

      Thou indeed defeated Indra again and again, Varuna was defeated when he kidnapped Nandagopa and Yama was defeated by Thee when he took away the children of Thy Guru. Agni, Vayu's friend was overcome when Thou drank it during the forest fire and Brahmaa was defeated when he stole away the calves. Shiva was defeated here in Baana's battle. Therefore, O Lord! this incarnation of Thee excels and wins over all other of Thy incarnations.

      It may be due to stupidity or due to believing the immature words of young people that Paundraka for long firmly believed in his mind that he himself was indeed Vaasudeva. This thought made him constantly be in oneness with Thee and so he attained Saayujya (union with Thee). Who knows whose good deeds lead him where and to what credit?

      Long ago Vividha, the monkey who had helped Thee in killing the Raakshasas (during Thy incarnation as Raama) nursed the desire to be killed by Thy part incarnation. As a minister of Narakaasura, he took to evil ways and started creating sufferings for the people in the vicinity of Dwaarika. In a fight with Balaraama, he was killed with ease by a blow of Balaraam's hand in no time.

      Saamba was a captive of the Kurus because he had abducted their daughter. Balaraam went to the Kurus to pacify them but was enraged by their talks and lifted up Hastinaapur and released Saamba. Thou did not send the Yaadava army to confront them, because Thou wanted that the Kurus be killed by the Paandavas. Thou whose sporting ways are unfathomable, O Lord of Guruvaayur! I worship Thee so as to remove my sufferings.

      Vasudeva asked the assembly of the great sages about the auspicious rites to be performed for the atonement for the sins. Even though the sages were very amused and laughed at such an enquiry, because having Thee as a son there was no need for any atonements. But they made him perform the required rites all the same.

Oh Thou who are the servant of Thy devotees was then sent by Yudhishthira to Jaraasandha along with Bheem and Arjuna.

Thou made the king of Magadha, Jaraasandha, who was lacking in good deeds, fight with Bheem. Meanwhile, Thou and Arjuna remained as onlookers and 'Raajayudhva' i.e. who make kings fight.

      Arrogant Jaraasandha was fighting ferociously in the battle.  Thou gave a hint to Bheema (that Jaraa's son could be killed by splitting) by splitting a twig.

They were all devoid of all desire, yet Thou engaged them to rule the earth ethically and as per Dharma.

      Thou deterred Thy allies, the Pandavas and Thyself cut off the head of the advancing adversary with Thy discus which cuts the Asuras. Chedi had gained a purified mind through his three births (as Hiranyakashipu, Raavana and Shishupa),where he was constantly thinking of Thee. Thus he attained the supreme union with Thee which is not easily attained by the Yogis.

      Then the most holy and elaborate sacrifice, the Raajasooya Yagna being completed by Thee, the people returned loudly acclaiming Thee and Yudhishthira. The wicked Duryodhana's mind was full of jealousy at the sight of the enemy's prosperity. He was all the more confused when he mistook the floor for water and water for floor in front of the assembly hall which was built by the Asura's architect Maya, for the Pandavas.

The purpose of this incarnation of Thee was to give liberation to all those who had for long fixed their minds on Thee.

      After Thy return to Dwaarikaa, a fraudulent game of dice took place in the assembly of the Kurus. Draupadi was dragged there by her hair. Piteously and helplessly crying she prayed to Thee. With compassion Thou endowed her with endless length of clothing. Further, when living in the forest, Draupadi was very frightened because sage Durvaasaa had come there with his people when the food was over. Draupadi again thought of Thee and Thou came to her rescue and ate a bit of the left over leafy vegetable and thereby satiated fully the hunger of the sage and his retinue.

      As the preparations of the war were on and strategies were decided, Arjuna asked Thee alone to be on his side. Agreeing to that, Thou gave Thy army to Duryodhana. Taking on the role of a messenger of the Pandavas, Thou went to Hastinaapur. Indeed Thy words were honoured by Bhishma, Drona and others but Duryodhana rejected them altogether. Revealing Thy Cosmic form in the assembly of the sages Thou shook up the entire Hastinaapur and returned to Dwaarikaa.

      In Thy role as Arjuna's charioteer, Thou saw the warrior sad and dejected in the face of the war, with the pitiful thought of having to kill his relations and his own people. Thou said to him 'O Friend! What is this? Aatman is eternal and only one. Who is the slain and who is the slayer here? Therefore giving up all fear of killing, surrender yourself to Me and carry out this righteous war.' By saying so and showing him Thy cosmic form, Thou brought Arjuna back to a balanced state of mind.

      Bhishma, one of the leading devotees was intent on helping in fulfilling Thy purpose of reducing the burden of the earth, and was killing almost 10,000 warriors everyday. Arjuna had become very exhausted in resisting Bheeshma. Forgetting Thy vow of not taking up arms in the war, Thou rushed towards Bheeshma with Thy great discus in hand as though in great anger. Bheeshma stood with folded hands and bent down his head as Thou approached him. Seeing him thus Thou were full of joy and desisted from attacking him.

      When the fight with Drona was going on Bhagadatta who was firmly seated on an elephant discharged the Vaishnava missile which Thou attracted towards Thy own chest and saved Arjuna. Arjuna was able to kill Jayadratha when Thy Sudarshana discus hid the rays of the sun. Again when Karna discharged the Naaga missile towards Arjuna, Thou lowered the earth by the pressure of Thy toe, so that only Arjun's crown got cut off and Arjuna was saved here also. What all did Thou not do for the benefit of the Paandavas.

      Just when the war was to begin Balaraama had gone away on a pilgrimage. He first covered the holy area of Naimishaaranya. Then he killed Suta for not having got up to honour him and installed his son in his place. Then he destroyed the Asura Valkala, who used to destroy the Yagnyas carried out on the full moon and new moon days. Completing his pilgrimage he returned to Kurukshetra. There when he saw the prolonged fight between Bheema and Duryodhana, he went away to Thy city of Dwaarika.

On Thy command Arjuna approached him and retracted the Brahmaastra discharged by him and clipped off his crest jewel.To cut off the line of the Paandavas, Ashwatthaamaa again sent the weapon into Uttara's womb to kill the foetus in there. To protect the foetus Thou entered her womb in the size of a thumb with Thy Sudarshana discus in hand.

      Kuchela set off for Thy place more out of eagerness to meet Thee than for acquiring a means of livelihood, as prodded by his wife, troubled by hunger. He had a repulsiveness towards wealth because of its proneness to generate pride and arrogance. He carried in a corner of his cloth some beaten rice as an offering to Thee.

      Thy mother had long back heard of Thy having brought back Thy teacher Saandipini's son and she desired of Thee to be shown her six dead sons. By Thy mother's words Thou went to the Sutala land and met Mahaabali and were greatly honoured by him. From there Thou brought back the six sons who were originally Marichi's sons and were later born to Hiranyakashipu by a curse of Brahmaa. They later took birth as Vasudeva and Devaki's sons, who were killed by Kansa. Thou took them to Thy abode.

      Again then in Dwaarikaa, there was a Braahmin whose children died just when they were born. To the wails and lamentations of the father Thou had just to say that who could resist fate. May be, I believe, seeing this Arjuna's mind was blunted into thinking that Thou were merely a human being. To curb his pride and to take him to the high level of realizing the Truth, Thou showed him the Supreme abode, Vaikuntha.

      When the tenth child was to be born, the proud Arjun went to the Braahmin's house without telling Thee. He made a protective web with his arrows and divine missiles around the labour room. Again suddenly the child's body disappeared. Immediately Arjun with his yogic powers went in search for the infant to the houses of Yama , Indra and other gods. As all his efforts were in vain he was about to enter the fire when Thou smilingly prevented him from doing so.

      O Lord! In those days Naarada who mostly stayed in Dwaarika was always engrossed in the bliss of Thy worship. Once Thy meritorious father attained insight and illumination from him who is the foremost among the devotees. The most distinguished among the intelligent, Uddhava attained enlightenment from instructions given by Thee directly. It is believed that he is still residing in Badrikaashrama for the benefit of the world.

      He indeed practiced severe penance and on the seventh day greatly angered, threatened to cut off his head and thus made Shiva appear before him immediately. From the Lord of the universe, Shiva, he sought a very mean and cruel boon that on who-so-ever's head he placed his hand would die immediately. How can good sense prevail upon people who are indifferent to Thee?

Test for yourself by placing your fingers on your own head.' Befooled by these words of Thine, he placed his hand on his head and immediately fell down dead as an uprooted tree. Such is the fate of the people who worship other deities. What more, Thou are the ultimate refuge of even Shiva.

      Once the ascetics residing on the banks of the river Saraswati assigned sage Bhrigu to test who among the Trinity was more inclined towards Saatvic guna. Bhrigu went to Brahmaa who was enraged, but he controlled his anger, when Bhrigu showed his disrespect. Next he went to Shiva and behaved with him in the same manner. Shiva was eager to kill him but was restricted by Paarvati. Then Bhrigu went to Thee.

      In his famous work of Mantra Shastra, known as Prapanchasaara, Shri Shankara has described Thee as transcending the Trinity - Brahmaa, Vishnu and Mahesh. He has described Thee as a beautiful blue lily and the Lord of all. When he describes the meditation on Nishkala, while dealing with Pranava, he also propounds Thy Sakala form, and of no other deity, Thee as the object of meditation.

      Arthavaada has three methods- 1) statements where existing facts are exaggerated, 2)statements are in accordance with experience, 3)statements are contrary to experience. These are used to make the subject matter interesting. In the Skaanda Puraana and other scriptures there are many contrary statements, referring to Thy Taamasic nature, Thy defeat or Thou being instructed by others etc., which are in the category of the third method.

      O Lord Krishna! I believe that the worship of Thy feet is the most fear expelling and the only refuge for those mortals who are suffering because of being deeply bound by the false material notions and wrong acceptance of ephemeral values as true. By devotion to Thee all fear is expelled, in every way, the methods of which are taught by Thee (in Bhagvad Geeta etc.). O Lord of Lords! O Soul of all Beings! A person who is steady in Thy devotion will not slip or falter even a wee bit even if he runs on the path of delusion with his eyes closed.

      The feeling of fear arises from the consciousness of a second entity-different from oneself. This consciousness of a second entity is a projection of the mind. I will try to control my mind with effort and discriminative intelligence. But when this discriminative intelligence is overpowered and inflicted by Maaya, the consciousness of oneness does not reveal itself again. Therefore, O Lord! by constantly worshipping Thee with great Bhakti, I will overcome all fear.

      Bhakti, devotion, is generated in people with meritorious deeds and it grows by association with people who are always worshipping at Thy feet. Just as in this world, wealth and prosperity are generated by association with prosperous people. O Lord! May I always have such association, because intense and firm devotion, which effaces all sins, arises as a result of listening to Thy glories and narrations of Thy sportive activities which are sung by such devotees.

      I shall salute the five elements, everything comprising of the elements, fishes, birds, animals and other mortals, friends and enemies with the knowledge that they are all Thy forms alone. Thus with my mind balanced with Bhakti I will always be in Thy service and worship Thee. With Thy grace then I will achieve firm devotion, dispassion and the knowledge of the Truth in Reality, simultaneously and will not have to make an effort to achieve each one separately. (Just as swallowing a morsel of food gives the satisfaction of enjoyment, strength and appeasing of hunger).

      Understanding that the rituals described in the Vedas are beyond their seeming results-oriented nature, I shall dedicate all such rituals that I perform, to Thee O Lord! And become free from the bondage of action.  May I not, even by mistake, by thought deed or speech attempt to do what is forbidden by the Vedas. If any such action becomes unavoidable, that too I will dedicate to Thee alone, O The Glowing Light of Consciousness!

      O Slayer of Mura! That this Kali Yuga may be victorious, wherein by chanting Thy various names and glories alone Thy grace is achieved effortlessly and in no time. O Fulfiller of All Desires! Those born in Treta Krita Dwaapara also desire to be born indeed in Kali Kaala. Fortunately, those of us who are born now, in Kali, may we not O Lord! be deprived of Thy grace, because of the pursuit of poisonous sensuous sense enjoyments.

      Once king Pareekshit saw the merciless Kali who is the enemy of Dharma (righteousness), and to kill him, he drew his sword also. But he did not kill Kali, because Kali is a knower of the essence of Truth, and also because it has some good features. In Kali, Thy worship bears results very soon where as evil deeds take time to bring fruits. Kali is also afraid of Thy devotees, so he tries to take them away by disease etc., even before their devotion becomes firm. For this O Lord! punish him.

      Thy grace alone will enable me to abandon my love and affection towards my relatives. With my mind merged in Thee, renouncing everything, I will wander about looking upon the whole world as an expression of Maayaa. The injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures apply to the one who entertains the concepts of good or bad due to multiplicity caused by false comprehension. How can both of these apply to a person whose mind is absorbed in Thee and who has transcended the consciousness of differences.

      There are countless beings who are always absorbed in satisfying their hunger and thirst. Among them, a man is superior for being endowed with a discriminative mind. Human birth indeed is rare. Among men also a person may be one's own friend or a foe. A person whose mind is absorbed in Thee, is always  concerned in the means of alleviating sorrow, is ones own friend. All others are their own foes.

      O Lord of the Universe! When Thy grace operates there is nothing in this worldly existence which may not become a spiritual teacher. I will learn the lesson of true forbearance from the earth who does not move in spite of being oppressed by all. The air is always in contact with various objects but is not tainted by them so I will learn nonattachment from the air. The nature of my soul which is all pervasive and unaffected, will be clear to me from the sky as a teacher.

O Lord! May I not be killed by others like the Kurara bird for having to guard the meat it was carrying.

      The spider is a teacher in the sense, that, I learnt from it that the Universe created by Thee, is absorbed into Thee, by Thee alone. From the beetle I got the firm lesson that meditating on Thee confers Thy form. On careful thought I realised that though this body is a storehouse of filth and ashes, it is a great teacher, specially this body of mine. Because of it suffering from many diseases, I have been endowed with discrimination and renunciation.

      People, whose minds are purified by performing desireless actions, come to understand from the instructions of competent teachers, Thy supreme aspect which is immaculate, bodiless, taintless, all pervading and transcendent. As for the qualities of multiplicity, stoutness, thinness etc., which are in association with the bodies constituted of the three gunas, are super imposed on Thee. It is like the expensiveness, small ness, dimness and brilliance of fire according to the nature of the fuel (wood) on which it manifests.

      The fire of knowledge is ignited by the striking of two fire sticks, the lower one represents the teachings of the teacher, and the upper one the disciple (who comes seeking the knowledge). This fire illuminates perfectly clear knowledge and burns the forest full of many tendencies and desires which are an effect of past actions, and also the ignorance of identification with the body and the world. When such a forest is burnt up, the fire (of knowledge) for want of fuel also subsides (in Thee). Then the state of total merger in Thee alone remains.

      Other than the attainment of Thee, certainly, the other means of eradicating sufferings, which are resorted to, like cultivation, medicine, the six gunas, the six steps of Yoga etc., are ultimately ineffective in completely removing or the recurrence of all sufferings. The Vedic paths are difficult to pursue with their many inherent difficulties. Even if they are somehow pursued and their results obtained, by some, they in arrogance forget Thee, (who are the ultimate aim) and are led into downfall and undergo endless sufferings.

      O Lord! In reality, for me, who is merged in Thyselfness only, there is no bondage or liberation. Thy two aspects of Maayaa and knowledge manifest, indeed, like dreaming and awakening. The difference between the two, the bonded and the one who has achieved liberation while living, is that, the former, perched on the tree of the body has to eat the fruits of the sense experiences, while the latter does not have to do so and so is a non suffering soul.

      Of what use are the words about the state of liberation in the embodied soul? This concept is far fetched for the impure minded. There is no way other than devotion for the mind to be even a bit purified. O Lord Vishnu! Do bring about that for me which by intense devotion, with surrendering of all fruits of action to Thee, and with Thy realisation by the teachings from a Guru, I may achieve oneness with Thee.

      The state of supreme blissful union with Thee is difficult to be attained by charity, sacrifice, vows, disciplines, austerities or by following the methods of Saankhya Yoga. The most meritorious Gopikaas attained intense bliss only by attachment to Thee. There are many devotees of Thine, but the loving devotion of the Gopikaas, to Thee, is highly esteemed by Thee. May that devotion strengthen in me. O Lord Krishna! O Lord of Guruvaayur! remove my sufferings.

      O Thou! The Origin of All! In the beginning Thou were in an undivided state of all jivas in the Hiranyagarbha form. Then Thou do manifest Thyself in multiplicity of jivas, and become associated with Maayaa and its various Gunas. With the well developed and dominant Sattva, devotional attitude is reached, by which the other two gunas Rajas and Tamas are destroyed. By and by when Sattva also is abandoned I (the jiva) shall, again, unobstructed, realise myself as Thyself only.

      O Infinite Being! When the Sattva Guna predominates, the harmfulness of sense enjoyments is realised. Whereas when the Rajas and Tamas are predominant, to abstain from worldly enjoyments becomes difficult, because the mind and the gunas are mutually interlinked. To control all these, devotion in Thy Tureeya state alone is the only refuge. Thus, in the form of a swan Thou instructed.

      Unless the heart melts with love, the hair of the whole body stand on end or tears of joy flow, how can the mind be purified. Of what use are austerities or learning devoid of devotion. Just as, by constant use of collyrium  the eyes can see the objects, the mind intuits Thy subtle truth by constant imbibing of Thy narrations and so purifying the soul. It is not so indeed by the study of highly sophisticated arguments.

      The three paths which lead to Thy attainment, in this world are, knowledge (Gyaana), action (Karma) and devotion (Bhakti). Those who are fully dispassionate towards everything in life, are competent for Gyaana marg. People who are subject to worldly attachments may take the path of Karma and dedicate all their doings to Thee. To those who are neither intensely attached nor intensely dispassionate and also experience joy in thinking of Thee, the path of Bhaakti is prescribed.

     <span>
      People who are attracted to the path of knowledge (Gyaana Yoga) seeking the non-manifest Brahman, by studying the Vedic revelations and Nyaaya Shaastra's logic, labour hard, and attain the ultimate goal at the end of many life times. Karma Yoga is far fetched from the ultimate goal. Certainly the path of devotion is sweet from the very beginning and quickly leads a devotee to Thee. May this Bhakti grow more and more in me.

      Sage Vyaasa decries excessive effort for seeking knowledge alone. Whoever, after learning from the scriptures or from a Guru the truth of Brahma, one who takes refuge with firmness in devotion at Thy feet, to him liberation is at hand. Meditation on Thee is no less difficult , because of the wavering nature of the mind, but can be mastered soon with practice, with Thy grace and with the attractiveness of Thy enchanting form.

      O Lord of the Universe! Becoming disinterested in the difficult path of Vedic rituals, I will firmly place my faith in the narrations of Thy stories etc. Even then, if I am not able to give up desires,I will indulge in them with the awareness of their harmfulness and again with determination fixing my mind in Thee, will strengthen my devotion. When Thou do abide in the heart, attachments are soon destroyed.

      A Brahmin, who had earned wealth with hard toil once, happened to lose it all. He had acquired discrimination and purity of mind, but was persecuted by the populace. He said that the people, or time, or Karmaa or planets were not the cause of his sorrow. His own mind was the cause, it being a product of the gunas. It super imposes the gunas on the ever free aatman and attributes to it the doer ship. With this knowledge he peacefully attained to Thee. O Lord! may I have that kind of peace of mind.

      All entities in this world, knowledge, faith, work, residence, happiness, food etc., being constituted of the three gunas, are of different kinds and different gradations, such as, low, mediocre or high.

      O Lord! In order to get firmly established in Bhakti Yoga, I need good health and long life. Fortunately, to achieve this also, service at Thy feet is to be done. Wonderful it is that the medicine is milk only. Long ago, Maarkandeya was told by an astrologer that his life span was of twelve years only. He worshipped intensely at Thy feet for one year and when death approached, it was driven away by Thy emissaries.

In the seventh Manvantra, the Indra there, tried to seduce him with the help of celestial damsels, soft breeze and Cupid the god of love.They did not succeed, rather they were scorched by the heat generated by the sage's yoga.

Thou offered to him various boons, but he did not care for them, being satisfied to his innermost self with devotion to Thee. Then he asked to see Thy Maayaa. Being ignorant of the sorrows caused by Maayaa, he chose this boon out of sheer curiosity.

      As soon as Thou left, the clouds were tossed about by unruly winds and torrential rain waters made the waters of the seven seas overflow, submerging the whole world. Maarkandeya wandered in these waters for millions of years. Exhausted, he saw far away, a wondrous Infant, Thee alone, with the body with a blue hue, lying on a banyan leaf, with the toe placed in the lotus mouth.

      Maarkandeya's body was full of horripilation and he rushed to touch Thee. He was drawn into Thee by Thy breath. There he saw the expanse of the whole world. Then thrown out by the breath, he was looked at by Thy sidelong glances. In great joy he approached Thee wanting to embrace Thee. Just then, Thy form disappeared and he found himself in his aashram as before.

      Lord Shiva, along with Gauri went to Maarkandeya, desirous of seeing Thy devotee. He gave the boons of freedom from old age and death etc., without being asked for, which the sage had also acquired by his penance. In this manner, Lord Shiva was also pleased by the worship of Thee alone. This also clearly shows that Thou are Trinity itself Brahmaa Vishnu and Shiva , and also the inner controller of all.

      It is Brahaman itself, on whose base this universe is manifested, from which this universe became, into which it merges, which itself is the universe, who is transcended from this all, from whose illumination the universe is illumined, whose illumination it is. Again, who is far beyond all description and also from the mind's conception. Whose true nature the gods and sages do not know, what of other lesser beings. To That Krishna, Brahaman itself, salutations.

When knowledge dawns, it becomes crystal clear through the total sublation of the objective world into Thyself, their substratum. To That Krishna! salutations.

Thou are one manifestation as the Trinity - Brahmaa Vishnu and Shiva. Thy true nature is sung of by the three Vedas. Thou as pure consciousness are aware of the three states of waking dream and sleep. Thou do take incarnation in the three Yugas, and cover the whole world in three strides. In the three periods of time - past present and future, Thou are unchanged. I always worship Thee by the means of three yogas - Gyaan, Bhakti and Karma.

      Who can recount the glories of the All Pervading Lord Vishnu or count the sand particles of the universe? The three strides of His feet alone measured the three worlds, and the worlds are full of joy with wealth and prosperity because of the touch of His feet. He alone is the support of the worlds. His supreme abode is dear to me and may I attain it, where Thy devotees enjoy bliss and the honey juice of immortality flows free.

      O Lord of the Universe! At first, at the beginning of the creation water came into existence and held Thee into themselves. O Lord Reclining on the Waters! All the jeevas then were merged and held in Thy being. On Thee the Birthless Lord! There rose one lone lotus from Thy naval with eight petals representing the eight quarters and the golden mountain (Mahaameru) as its pericarp representing all the worlds.

      In front of me I see a bluish radiance excelling a very thick array of Kalaaya (blue lily) flowers. I am bathed in the nectar of the sight. Then, in the centre of the radiance I see the form of a divine young body enchanting by the budding of youth. He is surrounded by sages like Naarada thrilled with ecstatic bliss, and by a group of beautiful women who are the Upanishads embodied.
