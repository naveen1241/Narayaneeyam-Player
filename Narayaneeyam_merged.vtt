[Meaning]:
O Supreme Lord! In this Kali Yuga, Gangaa, Geetaa, Gaayatri, Tulsika, Gopichandana, Saalagraama worship, Ekaadashi fast and chanting of Thy names, these eight, the sages say, are quick and effortless means of salvation as they secure Thy abounding grace. O Thou! May I be intensely devoted to them all.

[Split explanation]:
बन्धु-स्नेहं विजह्यां	to (my) relatives affection (I will) give up
तव हि करुणया	by Thy grace alone
त्वयि-उपावेशित-आत्मा	in Thee merged my mind
सर्वं त्यक्त्वा चरेयं	abandoning everything will wander about
सकलम्-अपि जगत्-वीक्ष्य	the whole world looking upon as only
माया-विलासम्	Maayaa's expression
नानात्वात्-भ्रान्तिजन्यात्	multiplicity due to false comprehension
सति खलु गुण-दोष-	so being, indeed, good and bad
अवबोधे विधि:-वा	its understanding or the does-
व्यासेध: वा कथं तौ	and don'ts, how come they both
त्वयि निहित-मते:-	into Thee (whose) absorbed is the mind
वीत-वैषम्य-बुद्धे:	and transcended the consciousness of differences

[Meaning]:
Thy grace alone will enable me to abandon my love and affection towards my relatives. With my mind merged in Thee, renouncing everything, I will wander about looking upon the whole world as an expression of Maayaa. The injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures apply to the one who entertains the concepts of good or bad due to multiplicity caused by false comprehension. How can both of these apply to a person whose mind is absorbed in Thee and who has transcended the consciousness of differences.

[Meaning]:
There are countless beings who are always absorbed in satisfying their hunger and thirst. Among them, a man is superior for being endowed with a discriminative mind. Human birth indeed is rare. Among men also a person may be one's own friend or a foe. A person whose mind is absorbed in Thee, is always concerned in the means of alleviating sorrow, is ones own friend. All others are their own foes.

The air is always in contact with various objects but is not tainted by them so I will learn nonattachment from the air. The nature of my soul which is all pervasive and unaffected, will be clear to me from the sky as a teacher.

Just as there is fire in every tree, let me recognize me in all beings. The growth and decay is of the body, like waxing and waning of the moon, and not of Aatman, the self. By Thy grace, may I realise, the oneness of all individual bodies, just like the reflected images of the sun in universal waters.

O Lord! May I not be killed by others like the Kurara bird for having to guard the meat it was carrying.

May my mind be absorbed in Thee and not know anything beyond that, like the arrow maker who does not know the announcement of the king's coming. May I live in houses made by others, and so be not attached to any house, like the snake who lives in the holes made by rats.

From the beetle I got the firm lesson that meditating on Thee confers Thy form. On careful thought I realised that though this body is a storehouse of filth and ashes, it is a great teacher, specially this body of mine. Because of it suffering from many diseases, I have been endowed with discrimination and renunciation.

In the end this body is fit only for fire or dogs. Even now, while living, it is dragged hither and thither by senses of sight hearing touch taste etc. There is none alas to take us to Thy lotus feet.

शान्तता-आदि	dimness etc.,

[Meaning]:
People, whose minds are purified by performing desireless actions, come to understand from the instructions of competent teachers, Thy supreme aspect which is immaculate, bodiless, taintless, all pervading and transcendent. As for the qualities of multiplicity, stoutness, thinness etc., which are in association with the bodies constituted of the three gunas, are super imposed on Thee. It is like the expensiveness, small ness, dimness and brilliance of fire according to the nature of the fuel (wood) on which it manifests.

भुवन-भ्रान्ति-	body identification misconception
कान्तार-पूरे	such a forest full (is burnt)
दाह्य-अभावेन	then with a lack of burning material
विद्या-शिखिनि च विरते	when the knowledge generated fire also subsides
त्वत्-मयी खलु-अवस्था	in Thee the total merger state alone (is there)

[Meaning]:
The fire of knowledge is ignited by the striking of two fire sticks, the lower one represents the teachings of the teacher, and the upper one the disciple (who comes seeking the knowledge). This fire illuminates perfectly clear knowledge and burns the forest full of many tendencies and desires which are an effect of past actions, and also the ignorance of identification with the body and the world. When such a forest is burnt up, the fire (of knowledge) for want of fuel also subsides (in Thee). Then the state of total merger in Thee alone remains.

मत्ता:-त्वां विस्मरन्त:	(becoming) arrogant, Thee, they forget

[Meaning]:
Other than the attainment of Thee, certainly, the other means of eradicating sufferings, which are resorted to, like cultivation, medicine, the six gunas, the six steps of Yoga etc., are ultimately ineffective in completely removing or the recurrence of all sufferings. The Vedic paths are difficult to pursue with their many inherent difficulties. Even if they are somehow pursued and their results obtained, by some, they in arrogance forget Thee, (who are the ultimate aim) and are led into downfall and undergo endless sufferings.

बद्धे जीवत्-विमुक्तिं	in a bonded and liberated, while living
गतवति च भिदा	is achieved, the difference is
तावती तावत्-एको	this much, that, one
भुङ्क्ते देह-द्रुम-स्थ:	eats, on a body tree perched
विषय-फल-रसात्	sense experience fruits
न-अपर: निर्व्यथ-आत्मा	not the other one, (and so), is a non suffering soul

[Meaning]:
O Lord! In reality, for me, who is merged in Thyselfness only, there is no bondage or liberation. Thy two aspects of Maayaa and knowledge manifest, indeed, like dreaming and awakening. The difference between the two, the bonded and the one who has achieved liberation while living, is that, the former, perched on the tree of the body has to eat the fruits of the sense experiences, while the latter does not have to do so and so is a non suffering soul.

त्वत्-प्रबोध:-त्वत्-आत्मा	Thy realisations and Thy oneness (may achieve).

[Meaning]:
Of what use are the words about the state of liberation in the embodied soul? This concept is far fetched for the impure minded. There is no way other than devotion for the mind to be even a bit purified. O Lord Vishnu! Do bring about that for me which by intense devotion, with surrendering of all fruits of action to Thee, and with Thy realisation by the teachings from a Guru, I may achieve oneness with Thee.

[Meaning]:
In this world there are people who are totally engrossed in the study of Vedas and other scriptures and do not care to know Thee. It is a futile effort on their part just as owning a cow which has not calved. I will not study the scriptures wherein Thy form saturated with Pure Consciousness, and the world enchanting, all purifying and sportive incarnations are not spoken of.

O Lord of the Universe! Thou are this, that or of that kind or of that sort, I do not at all understand any of this whatsoever. In spite of my little understanding, O Enemy of Chaidya (Shishupaal)! Thy worship alone I will always dutifully perform. May it thus happen to me that I get to see Thy images and touch the feet of the groups of people who are lovingly attached to Thy feet. May I also worship Thee, sing Thy hymns, prostate to Thee, and lovingly recite Thy excellences and deeds.

[Meaning]:
The state of supreme blissful union with Thee is difficult to be attained by charity, sacrifice, vows, disciplines, austerities or by following the methods of Saankhya Yoga. The most meritorious Gopikaas attained intense bliss only by attachment to Thee. There are many devotees of Thine, but the loving devotion of the Gopikaas, to Thee, is highly esteemed by Thee. May that devotion strengthen in me. O Lord Krishna! O Lord of Guruvaayur! remove my sufferings.

भक्ति-भावं गतेन	when devotion attitude is got
छित्वा सत्त्वं च हित्वा	destroying (the other two) and Sattva also leaving behind
पुन:-अनुपहित:	again unobstructed
वर्तिताहे त्वम्-एव	shall remain Thyself only

[Meaning]:
O Thou! The Origin of All! In the beginning Thou were in an undivided state of all jivas in the Hiranyagarbha form. Then Thou do manifest Thyself in multiplicity of jivas, and become associated with Maayaa and its various Gunas. With the well developed and dominant Sattva, devotional attitude is reached, by which the other two gunas Rajas and Tamas are destroyed. By and by when Sattva also is abandoned I (the jiva) shall, again, unobstructed, realise myself as Thyself only.

प्रोद्धते दुर्निवारा	attraction is difficult to overcome

ग्रथितम्-इह मिथ:-	interlocked here mutually

तुर्ये त्वयि-एक-भक्ति:-	in the Turiya Thee alone devotion
शरणम्-इति	is the refuge, thus
भवान् हंस-रूपी न्यगादीत्	Thou, in the form of a swan instructed

[Meaning]:
O Infinite Being! When the Sattva Guna predominates, the harmfulness of sense enjoyments is realised. Whereas when the Rajas and Tamas are predominant, to abstain from worldly enjoyments becomes difficult, because the mind and the gunas are mutually interlinked. To control all these, devotion in Thy Tureeya state alone is the only refuge. Thus, in the form of a swan Thou instructed.

ननु महिततमां	indeed super glorious
श्रेयसां भक्तिम्-एकां	and welfare bringing devotion alone
त्वत्-भक्ति-आनन्द-तुल्य:	Thy devotion's bliss in comparison
खलु विषय-जुषां सम्मद:	for people engrossed in worldly pleasures
केन वा स्यत्	by what can there be

[Meaning]:
There are many paths of welfare laid down to suit varying tastes of people as means of fulfilment. O Krishna! They lead to goals that yield only temporary and trivial pleasures. Thou did describe to Thy friend, Uddhava, devotion as the most glorious path for attainment of supreme spiritual welfare of man. Where does the joy that people get by worldly pursuits, stand in comparison to the bliss of devotion to Thee!

इन्द्रलोकं कमलज-भवनं	Indraloka or Brahamaa's residence
योग-सिद्धी:-च हृद्या:	or Yogic powers attractive
न-आकाङ्क्षति-	does not covet for
एतत्-आस्तां	may this be so
स्वयम्-अनुपतिते	by itself coming (to him)
मोक्ष-सौख्ये-अपि-अनीह:	the liberation bliss also is not desired for

[Meaning]:
A person whose mind is satisfied in Thy devotion, moves about happily in this world. One who has dropped all desires, for him, every place is full of joy, just like an aquatic creature living in deep waters, finds water everywhere. Such a person does not covet Indraloka or Brahmaa's residence or the attractive Yogic powers. This may be so. The bliss of liberation coming of its own to him is also without his seeking.

पुन:-अपि खलु	again also indeed
तै:-दुर्बलै:-न-अभिजय्य:	by them, the weak senses are not conquered
सप्तार्चि:-दीपितार्चि:-दहति	the fire well lit burns down
किल यथा भूरि-दारु-प्रपञ्चम्	indeed, just as, a great heap of wood
त्वत्-भक्ति-ओघे तथा-एव	in Thy devotion's stream in the same manner
प्रदहति दुरितं	burns up sins (and sinful tendencies)
दुर्मद: क्व-इन्द्रियाणाम्	the false power, of senses, where (does it stand)

[Meaning]:
If Thy devotee is sometimes ensnared by sense pleasure, because of his senses not being in his control fully, they by nature weak, cannot stand the onslaught of devotion and so Thy devotee cannot be conquered by the senses. Just as a well lit blazing fire burns down stacks and heaps of wood, in the same way Thy devotion burns away stacks of sins and sinful tendencies. When this happens, the false power of the senses do not stand any chance.

मरीमृज्यमान:-अयम्-आत्मा	purification of this soul
चक्षु:-वत्-तत्त्व-सूक्ष्मं	like the eyes (which reveal the objects), the subtle truth
भजति न तु तथा-	is revealed, not so indeed
अभ्यस्तया तर्ककोट्या	by the study of highly sophisticated arguments

[Meaning]:
Unless the heart melts with love, the hair of the whole body stand on end or tears of joy flow, how can the mind be purified. Of what use are austerities or learning devoid of devotion. Just as, by constant use of collyrium  the eyes can see the objects, the mind intuits Thy subtle truth by constant imbibing of Thy narrations and so purifying the soul. It is not so indeed by the study of highly sophisticated arguments.

O Ocean of Compassion! destroy all my sorrows and confer a full abundant flow of Supreme Bliss.
